# RobotGUI
RobotGUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Python that connects to an Arduino board and performs image processing tasks. Thanks to its integration with OpenCV, pyserial, and tkinter libraries, the application enables face detection, color recognition, and QR code scanning, as well as controlling servo motors and reading sensor data.
